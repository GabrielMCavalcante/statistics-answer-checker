# Statistics Study Helper

![Project Image](src/github/frontpage.jpg)

> This is a project to help you build tables that gives you information about data.

This web application was built thinking of how boring it can be to check every answer
of a statistics exercise, by having to manually revise all calculations, which can not
only make things harder and passive of errors, but make statistics look like a monster.
With this application, you can easily check out all the relevant information about the
exercise given set of data, by simply passing it to the application. From a simple table of absolute frequencies of each individual data to a complete table of absolute and relative frequencies, you will have all the information you need.
